# Our Lil' Lunchbox Database

This is the backend code for [Our Lil' Lunchbox](https://incandescent-toffee-ab615c.netlify.app/). The data includes several food objects, each containing keys for the food's name, origin, emoji, story, id, yums and ews (upvotes and downvotes). Each food object is rendered to the homepage as a FoodItem card, as well as a list item on the /allfoods route. The data is currently being hosted by [Render](https://phase-2-lunchbox-data.onrender.com/foods/) using [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Sources and Contributions
The code used [this json server template by lizbur10 on github](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template) to set up the initial backend directory.

The live site uses [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and [Render](https://render.com/) to host its backend data, with its front end hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This app was made for Flatiron School's Software Engineering Flex Program Phase 2. I've learned a lot this phase! Thank you!!
